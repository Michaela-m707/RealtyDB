Description: This is a database set up for the CINF 201 final project. This project will create a data base for a faux realty company with its main fields being realty agents, and listings under two categories: renting and Buying. The website consists of a welcome page with an interactive carousel and navigation links.
Each renting and buying page has sample listing that displays data from the data base and also has a schedule tour button. When the button is clicked, the user can enter their information and schedule their appointment. They will recieve a confirmation message and the data is sent to a designated table for scheduled tours. In the data base the properties are connected to two joint tables (renting and buying) as well as the agents. The agents are assignment based of housing type.
